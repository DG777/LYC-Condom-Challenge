adjust penis heights in media queries

adjust media queries to UI

allow penis to be dragged below screen level (contained within separate div?)

constrain penis resize

jquery resizable helper z-index needs to be behind pants-front


1)      Add in a transparent instructional panel on the Construction screen. These will only show up once and disappear with the first click.
Text for penis arrows: “Drag here to adjust the size of your dick.”
Text for circumcision boxes: “Cut/Uncut? Select here!”

2)      The text for the penis length doesn’t adjust when the arrows are dragged.

3)      Penis length and girth need to have ranges built in that they can’t go above or below:

Length range: 80mm to 250mm
Girth Range: 60mm to 200mm (I wrote 45-69 in the final brief which was using diameter, not circumference. This was a mistake on my part – sorry!).

The final recommendations will be based on the input girth, so will fall into these size ranges:

Snug: 60-100mm
Regular: 110-140mm
Large: 150-200mm

 

4)      At the moment, the penis size that loads up clicks through to the large condom sizes. It would be better if this clicked through to a recommendation for Regular (eg if the user doesn’t play with the settings at all) – let’s load it up to start at 140mm for length and 125mm for girth.

5)      When dragged, the penis base extends out beyond the fly of the jeans – this shouldn’t happen.

6)      On the mobile version, let’s reorder it so the recommendation comes first, followed by the “Order free condoms” button, with the video at the bottom.

 

7)      Add in a share to Facebook button on the final recommendation screen. This will export the image, with placeholder text for the post as “I just built my dick at EndingHIV.org.nz!”
