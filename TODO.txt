1)      Add in a transparent instructional panel on the Construction screen. These will only show up once and disappear with the first click.
Text for penis arrows: “Drag handles to adjust the size of your dick.”
Text for circumcision boxes: “Cut/Uncut? Select here!”

2)      The text for the penis length doesn’t adjust when the arrows are dragged.


7)      Add in a share to Facebook button on the final recommendation screen. This will export the image, with placeholder text for the post as “I just built my dick at EndingHIV.org.nz!”
