<!--
* Yes/No question:
    “Do you or your partner experience itchy or irritated skin from condoms?”

* Pop up regardless of the answer:
    “Some people have an allergy to latex which can make condom use uncomfortable. If this sounds like you, have a look for condom packs with the words “non-latex” or “polyisoprene”. These offer the same protection as latex condoms, even for anal sex.”
