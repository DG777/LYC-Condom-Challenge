<!--
* Yes/No question:
    “Do you get enough sensation from the condoms you use?” (Yes, they give me enough sensation/No, I’d like a condom with more sensation)

* /Pop up regardless of the answer:
    “There are plenty of thinner condoms on the market that will give you more feeling during sex. These are just as effective at preventing transmission of HIV and other STIs as regular condoms, and are no more likely to break.”
