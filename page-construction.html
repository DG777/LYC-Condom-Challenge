 * Penis bulding div
 * 2 other skin colour toggles, penis head stays the same

 * Cicrcumcision option, windows pop up when toggled:
        “Most uncircumcised guys should be able to roll the foreskin back to expose the head of the penis before putting on a condom. However, if the foreskin is quite long or is too tight to roll back, a condom can be put on without retracting the foreskin.”

 * Next screen button, when pressed a pop up appears:
        “Using the right rubber makes a massive difference, and in New Zealand we’re lucky enough to have a range of sizes funded by Pharmac. This means that once you’ve found the size for you, you can get them at a heavily discounted price from your nurse or doctor.”
